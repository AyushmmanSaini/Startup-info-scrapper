# Startup-info-scrapper

This project includes three programs.
1) finding_websites.py :  This script scrapes the name of startups and their websites from Startup India website.
2) zauba_profile.py: This scripts scrapes the info of startups from zaubacorp.com using the list of names of startups.
3) number_fetch.py: The phn numbers of the companies is not avaiable on either of the websites so, this script scrapes the phone numbers from their individual websites. Though this script is not at all perfect can find 2-3 phn numbers from 10 different websites.

If you want to use these script you will have to make loads of changes coz this is my first project on github so I did not commit the code on every step.
